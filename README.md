### Hi there 👋

I am an outgoing fourth-year Computing student at Imperial College London. 

- 🤔 I'm interested in scalable systems and program optimisation.
- ⚙️ I have experience with: `.cpp`, `.py`, `.cs`, `.java`, `.kt`, `.c`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.sh`, `.dfy`
- ⚡ I'm mostly active in [Department of Computing Society](https://docsoc.co.uk/), organising [IC Hack 23](https://ichack.org/)
- ✏️ I also write a [blog](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~kjc20/). Read my most recent post about MapReduce!

Some side projects I have worked on:
- [Multipaxos](https://github.com/khemichew/multipaxos): An implementation of a fault-tolerant protocol that achieves consensus
between replicas on multiple values as its state and how the values are ordered
- [MapReduce](https://github.com/khemichew/MapReduce): A distributed framework that crunches datasets and compute results
by writing a Map and Reduce function
- [WACC](https://github.com/khemichew/WACC-Compiler): A compiler that converts WACC code into ARM assembly code. 
- Pintos: A monolithic operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture, complete with multiple selectable priority 
schedulers, system calls, and virtual memory support
- [m,n,k-game](https://github.com/khemichew/RustCourse/tree/main/tictactoe): A game where a player wins when they have k-in-a-row
on a m-by-n board. This implementation allows you to play with the AI with optimised behaviour.
